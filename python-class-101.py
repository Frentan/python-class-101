# Starting out with a simple addition program:
num1 = 2
num2 = 1
sum = num1 + num2
print(sum)
# Use print() to insert empty lines and keep your output orderly:
print()
# Unlike JavaScript and C, it's not mandatory to use semicolons at the end of statements.
# Neither are curly braces "{}" used to represent blocks. Everything is done with indentation:
    #I_am_a_parent
    #    I_am_a_child
    #        I_am_a_grandchild
    #    I_am_another_child
    #        I_am_another_grandchild

print()
# And finally, a neat easter egg to inspire your journey:
import this
