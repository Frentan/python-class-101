# Starting out with a simple addition program:
num1 = 2
num2 = 1
sum = num1 + num2
print(sum)
# Use print() to insert empty lines and keep your output orderly:
print()
# Unlike JavaScript and C, it's not mandatory to use semicolons at the end of statements.
# Neither are curly braces "{}" used to represent blocks. Everything is done with indentation:
"""
I_am_a_parent
    I_am_a_child
        I_am_a_grandchild
    I_am_another_child
        I_am_another_grandchild
"""
# Variables "store" values. To use the classic example:
message = "Hello, World!"
print(message)
# But we can change a variable's value at any point:
message = "Python is my favorite programming language :-)"
print(message)
# Variable names can only have letters, numbers, and underscores, but they cannot start with a number or be the same as reserved keywords.
print()
# CONTINUE WITH STRINGS (PAGE 59)
print()
# And finally, a neat easter egg to inspire your journey:
import this
